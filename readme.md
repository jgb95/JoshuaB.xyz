# JoshuaB.xyz

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, [JoshuaB.xyz](https://joshuab.xyz). This site is built primarily with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator. It uses the [Aether theme for hugo](https://github.com/josephhutch/aether) I generate the photo albums locally, with a Python tool called [Sigal](https://sigal.saimon.org). For more information on these tools, check out the documentation on their websites.
